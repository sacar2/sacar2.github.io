<div id="about">
	<h2 class="inline">Hi I'm Selin! I'm a user experience designer based in Toronto.</h2>
    <p class="inline">A software engineering grad (BESc Western University '17, Canada), I've been working as a tech consultant at Avanade (an Accenture + Microsoft venture) since 2017. Gas/utilities, oil, housing, telecommunications, food, spirituality, banking, and transportation - I've worked in a variety of industries under various roles (all related to user experience design and web/iOS development). My diverse experience coupled with my belief in user-centered design helps me easily adapt to projects and to take on challenges.</p>
    <p>My mix of technical understanding and eye for design brings a unique perspective that results in thorough designs and better communication with developers. It's truly a balance between the user's needs and expectations, business goals, and feasibility, all while being an advocate for every team. Through research, design, implementation, launch, and maintenance, I've experienced the full life cycle of product development and aim to provide value wherever I'm helping out in the process.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I travel, play board games, discover skincare products, drink bubble tea, and I run a small business <a href="https://www.sende.ca">(www.sende.ca)</a> with one of my oldest friends.</p>
