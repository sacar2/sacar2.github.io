    <p class="role">User Experience Designer @ a Top Five Canadian Bank</p>
    <p class="description">Rebuilding two platforms from this Canadian big five bank, from the ground up with new microservices and a completely new front end. Undertaking the designs of six different sections (mini-projects) among the two business banking platforms, was a challenge my pod was up for.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Our pod was in charge of six sections between two business banking platforms. These sections would allow business customers to: send and receive payments, authorize payments, manage business account transaction limitations, deal with remittance information, and track wire payments. Many of these processes were done manually with people and paper, so our pod had to design the manual processes for the digital space, as well as add in new functionality.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>We needed to ensure the six functionalities mentioned were designed for, while ensuring the processes were as lean as possible. Knowing nothing about the current experiences of those who require these functions, we needed to first understand the users and more about the existing processes.</p>
<p>Also, to design for the platforms, it was necessary to study the style guide, any existing or related interaction designs, touch base with other pods working on other functions, and understand the platform's various purposes.</p>
<p>Because this project was essentially six mini projects, one for each section we covered, the work was fast paced. We worked closely with business to keep the project on track and up to/above expectations.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>There were six different sections to focus on, so we worked on them simultaneously, with more focus on one or two at a time, since they relied on each other. To ensure we got feedback from technology and other stakeholders earlier in the process, we focused on one to two of the sections at a time.<p>
<p>We worked in three main phases within the approved design tool, Adobe XD:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>High-Level Design </b>(creating high-level flows and wireframes)</li>
    <li><b>Detailed Design </b>(creating detailed annotated wireframes including all states and edge cases)</li>
    <li><b>Visual Design </b>(creating design specifications accurate to the expected look and feel)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>To get to the brink of development, we had to work with subject matter experts (SMEs), project managers, developers, a visual designer, and a copywriter to ensure the designs were fully fleshed out for our users and for development.</p>
<p>The first two weeks on the project were spent doing research. Going through existing files, participating in meetings, and asking a ton of questions. My UX design collegue and I had the opportunity to have multiple meetings with  SMEs and some of our end-users (employee business banking platform users). These meetings helped us better understand the processes being digitized and the pain points of the business banking users who would be using the new systems. Some of these processes were completely manual so digitizing them required an in-depth understanding of the existing manual processes.</p>
<img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-bank/meeting-questions.jpg" alt="questions and notes taken during a meeting">
    <small>Many questions were prepared before the SME meetings, and loads of information captured during the meetings. All this data was synthesized afterwards to help guide the designs.</small>

<h3>1: High-level Design Phase</h3>
<p>From the gathered information by undergoing research, we decided to hold stakeholder meetings three times a week to ensure we kept on track and could iterate as needed. In this phase, we created high-level user task flows for the happy paths, and the unhappy paths. These were iterated upon until we gained stakeholder approval.</p>
<img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-bank/highlevelflow.jpg" alt="high level flow from Adobe XD">
    <small>Our high level flows captured the most common screens related to a user's task.</small>
    
<h3>2: Detailed Design Phase</h3>
<p>In the client contract, our deliverables were a high-level design with annotations for development. Pretty straightforward, <em>right?</em> But once we dived into the finer details, more documentation would be necessary to ensure the developers had what they needed to implement accurate designs. The work extended to include flow charts, state diagrams, word documents and anything that would help the ideas our pod designed to come into existence. Our general process ended up going like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Creating high-level designs and any supplementary documentation that would help development and business understand, including flow charts and state diagrams.</li>
    <li>Including edge cases, error states, and anything short of visual designs.</li>
    <li>Highlighting features for future state development vs short-term development.</li>
    <li>Adding to the changelog at the top of the design file.</li>
    <li>Exporting a PDF of the newest version of designs for developers.</li>
    <li>Creating a meeting agenda and questions to ask business and technology.</li>
    <li>Presenting designs at the stakeholder meeting, getting approvals and answers, and finding out any new changes, requirements, and constraints.</li>
    <li>Updating designs.</li>
    <li>Reiterate and repeat all steps until stakeholders approve.</li>
</ol>

    <small>Interaction patterns had to be considered, so after research on best practices, I outlined how navigation should be handed throughout the platforms. This was later included in our design system.</small>

<h3>3: Visual Design Phase</h3>
<p>The visual designer we worked with was the same visual designer for multiple pods. Her capacity made it also the job of myself and my UX design team member to complete some of the visual designs, and ensure we got them approved from the visual designer.</p>
<p>At the time of the project, Adobe XD did not provide a way to show design specifications to document viewers, and the developers and stakeholders consuming the design documentation preferred PDF. Due to this, all visual design specifications had to be explicitly specified. Sizing for character, icon, and font sizing were supported by the style guide</p>

Inspect wasn't a thing for this project as the developers and all business personnel requested PDF documentation for hand off rather than jumping into the cloud files. Note: do to this inefficiency and many other reasons, Figma is being transitioned to in the organization.</small>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Given the user tasks to solve for and many new asks throughout the project, the number of potential pages <em>grew quickly</em>. Not to mention, we were facing a few other challenges: an inconsistent design system, and my UX designer teammate and I have both never worked with Adobe XD before. Hiccups we encountered included <b>lost work, sync issues, and time lost by not fully utilizing Adobe XD's features</b>.</p>

    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 1: Technical constraints and scope changes</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>We ran into multiple blockers that stemmed from technical constraints during the process. We had a large scope and little time, but we were able to surpass these blockers and bring efficiency by ensuring communication among our team and stakeholders were clear. Design ideas were brought up as early as possible to development and business to determine any technical limitations (especially evident in companies with legacy software). We streamlined meetings with stakeholders by sending out an agenda prior to and emailing any questions that didn't require a meeting. Changes were logged in all working files and included with every deliverable, to help everyone keep track.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 2: Inconsistent design system</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>The platforms we were designing for had strict accessibility constraints, so we relied on pre-existing components that had approval from legal, accessibility, etc. Any new components required a strong case and to be fully reviewed by accessibility.</p>
        <p>As soon as I started the project, I realized that the design system we had been using was missing details required for development. Upon further search, older components included those missing specifications but were inconsistent with the newer design system. I brought this up to the bank's experience design lead early in the project.</p>
        <p>From that discussion, our pod started our own fleshed-out visual design component library and design system we used for all our six mini-projects. We held weekly sessions to discuss progress, components, and make decisions. This design system included things that were not clear in the older design systems, and new components and interactions related to our mini projects. This initiative helped us greatly to get through our delivery dates and ensured that the correct interactions and sizes were available to developers. <small>Note: This was a priority, but as the project unravelled, we discovered a team undertook the task of creating a design system for <em>all</em> of the bank's various platforms. This was great news; learning something better would be coming in the future. If the initiative didn't exist, it would be something I would have pushed the design leads and ultimately the client to undertake.</small></p>

    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 3: Improving our workflow as a team while using the ever so buggy Adobe XD</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>As the number of pages we created increased, Adobe XD didn't want to cooperate. Errors regularly came up: component elements were out of place, XD was processing slowly, and work was sometimes completely erased. The 'reset component' feature helped with the misplaced elements on an artboard. Closing XD frequently helped clear our RAM, and better structure in our components and layers helped keep XD working smoothly. In the beginning, we didn't even use components because we didn't know they existed, but after we figured it out, it saved so much time. With work being completely erased frequently due to the bug, we had to pay more attention to when things were last synced and not walk over each other's toes.</p>
        <p>To get through our tight deadlines without issues, we increasingly had remote work sessions. We hopped on a call, shared screen when required, and just talked through what we were doing to maximize efficiency. This was also helpful when ideating.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 4: Working with the copywriter</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>I quickly learned that sending over the latest designs with a list of changes was not the easiest for the copywriter to work off of. We had to figure out a streamlined approach to make the job as smooth as possible on both sides. So, I came up with a better process - to create a document with the exact component and copy requirements for every component requiring updates. This took me an extra half-hour once a week but saved a lot of meeting time and back and forth emails, and quickened the turnaround time for copy changes from the copywriter. Definitely a win!</p>
    </div>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We delivered six experience design files with over 200 pages and associated states for desktop and mobile for two platforms and users with annotations, diagrams, and flows. We also:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li>Presented and delivered designs, highlighting areas of risk to both the business and developers.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with designers on other pods to align new designs with existing design patterns.</li>
    <li>Improved the process for working with the copywriter, making updates more efficient.</li>
    <li>Identified areas for improvement within the existing design team's resources and design processes, initiating discussions and kick-starting an improvement plan. We also included actionable suggestions that were then carried out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>While designing, we wanted to be future-ready especially considering designs take months to build out and eventually rolled out. To ensure future work did not get lost, we kept them in the working file and annotated the current versus future states, clearly outlining their UI and functionality.</p>
<p>Given the crazy amount of work completed over the seven months, the working file was a living, breathing document. Still, some things definitely needed to be passed to future designers for reference and future iterations. Person-to-person knowledge transfer is not feasible and separate documentation may be a security issue, so we decided to utilize the working file. We were already outlining parked designs for future work in red, but I made sure to create notes on the working file explaining where our pod left off and why specific design decisions were made. This was to help bridge that gap that was always apparent when picking up where past designers left off; often causing duplicate work without knowing it. Paired with concise annotations, we felt confident in the work we completed.</p>

<div>
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <h3>Mastered Adobe XD skills and component everything</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>This project really taught me how to use XD at a high and efficient level. I learned to utilize components extensively, ensure components are well structured, and now understand the collaboration limitations of XD. Also, closing XD at least twice a day prevented my laptop from exploding. </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Bring in visual design earlier</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>Visual design coming in late in the process made things difficult. Given the incomplete design system, sometimes existing components I was not aware of would be better suited to the page being designed. Having visual design onboard earlier and there for each design, or even coming up with a smoother workflow to translate wireframes into actual visual design components would have been helpful. That way, stakeholders could see the ideas come to life sooner, repetitive work could be minimized, and knowledge from the visual designer could be brought to the table sooner.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Be strategic when to bring in a copywriter</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>Every project is different, and bringing in a copywriter early on can save a project money and headache later. For this particular project, with things rapidly changing, having the copywriter step in too early brought a lot of rework for the copywriter. These pages weren't heavy on content as they were on the processes and updating the experience on the pages, so the content generated early on was often removed or changed. There was a lot of work on myself to highlight every little copy change that needed to be addressed, not just for one version of the design but several. Having over 14 revisions of the copy deck at the end of the process was a lot. Bringing in the copywriting a little later for each mini project in this particular project would have made the process less confusing.</p>
