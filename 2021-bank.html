    <p class="description">Rebuilding two platforms from this Canadian big five bank, from the ground up with new microservices and a completely new front end. Undertaking the designs of six different sections (mini-projects) among the two business banking platforms, was a challenge my pod was up for.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Our pod was in charge of six sections between two business banking platforms. These sections were to allow business customers to send and receive payments, authorize payments, manage business account transaction limitations, deal with remittance information, and track wire payments. Many of these processes were done manually with people and paper, so our pod had to design the manual processes for the digital space, as well as add in new functionality.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Ultimately, we needed high-level wireframes, detailed annotated designs, and a visual design for the six main sections, utilizing the approved design tool, Adobe XD. Knowing nothing about the product, we needed to first understand a little more about the existing processes, style guide, and platform by carrying out a little research.</p>
<p>Because this project was essentially six mini projects, one for each section we covered, the work was fast paced. We worked closely with business to keep the project on track and up to/above expectations. </p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>There were six different sections to focus on, so we worked on them simultaneously since they relied on each other. To ensure we got feedback from technology and other stakeholders earlier in the process, we focused on one to two of the sections at a time.<p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>To get to the brink of development, we had to work with subject matter experts (SMEs), project managers, developers, a visual designer, and a copywriter to ensure the designs were fully fleshed out for our users and for development.</p>
<p>Weeks one and two were spent getting to know the project. Going through existing files, participating in meetings, and asking a ton of questions. My UX design collegue and I had the opportunity to have multiple meetings with  SMEs and some of our end-users (employee business banking platform users). These meetings helped us better understand the processes being digitized and the pain points of the business banking users who would be using the new systems. Some of these processes were completely manual so digitizing them required an in-depth understanding of the existing manual processes.</p>
<img class="project-image" src="2021-bank-images/meeting-questions.jpg" alt="questions and notes taken during a meeting">
    <small>Many questions were prepared before the SME meetings, and loads of information captured during the meetings. All this data was synthesized afterwards to help guide the designs.</small>
<h3>High-level flows</h3>
<p>From the gathered information, we decided to hold stakeholder meetings three times a week. We then created the high-level flows for the happy paths and after, the unhappy paths.</p>
<h3>Detailed Designs + Iteration</h3>
<p>After iterating the paths and receiving stakeholder approval, we worked on finer details in the detailed design phase. In the client contract, our deliverables were a high-level design with annotations for development. Pretty straightforward, <em>right?</em> But once we dived into the details, it wasn't just the high-level flows and annotated detailed designs, but also flow charts, state diagrams, word documents and anything that would help the ideas our pod designed to come into existence. Our general process ended up going like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Creating high-level designs and any supplementary documentation that would help development and business understand, including flow charts and state diagrams.</li>
    <li>Including edge cases, error states, and anything short of visual designs.</li>
    <li>Highlighting what would be future state development vs short-term development.</li>
    <li>Adding to the changelog at the top of the design file.</li>
    <li>Export current designs as a PDF for developers.</li>
    <li>Creating a meeting agenda and questions to ask business and technology.</li>
    <li>Presenting designs at the daily meeting with stakeholders, getting approvals and answers, and finding new changes/requirements/constraints.</li>
    <li>Updating designs.</li>
    <li>Reiterate/repeat all steps.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Given the user tasks to solve for and many new asks throughout the project, the number of potential pages <em>grew quickly</em>. Not to mention, we were facing a few other challenges: an inconsistent design system, and my UX designer teammate and I have both never worked with Adobe XD before. Hiccups we encountered included lost work, sync issues, and time lost by not fully utilizing Adobe XD's features.</p>

    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 1: Technical constraints and scope changes</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>We ran into multiple blockers that stemmed from technical constraints during the process. Adding on to the fact that the project scope was already so large for the time given, we were able to surpass these blockers by ensuring communication among our team and stakeholders was clear. Design ideas were brought up as early as possible to development and business to find out if there were any technical limitations (especially evident in older companies with legacy software). We streamlined our meetings with stakeholders by sending out and keeping an agenda prior to, and emailing any questions that didn't require a meeting. We did our best to keep track of changes by including a change log in every deliverable sent out and in the working design files.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 2: Inconsistent design system</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>Since the platforms we were designing for had strict accessibility constraints, we relied on pre-existing components which already had approval from the respective teams (legal, accessibility, etc.). Any new components had to have a strong case and be fully reviewed by accessibility. As soon as I started the project, I realized that the design system we had been using for the platforms was missing certain details required for development. Upon further search, older components included those missing variables but were inconsistent with the newer design. Quickly realizing this early in the project, I brought this up to the experience design lead at the bank. From that discussion, our pod started our own fleshed-out visual design component library and design system we used for all our six mini-projects. We held weekly sessions to discuss progress and components and make decisions. This design system included things that were not clear in the older design systems and new components and interactions related to our projects. This initiative really helped us get through our delivery dates and ensured that the correct interactions and sizes were delivered to the developers. <small>Note: This was highlighted as a priority, but as the project unravelled, we discovered a team undertook the task of creating a design system for all of the bank's various platforms. This was great news; learning something better would be coming in the future. If the initiative didn't exist, it would be something I would have pushed the design leads and ultimately the client to undertake.</small></p>

    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 3: Improving our workflow as a team while using the ever so buggy Adobe XD</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>As the number of pages we created increased, Adobe XD really wasn't cooperating. Errors regularly came up: component elements were out of place, XD was processing slowly, and work was sometimes completely erased. We learned about 'reset component', which helped with the misplaced elements. Closing XD more frequently to clear up our RAM, and structuring components and layers in our files more cleanly helped keep XD working smoothly. In the beginning, we didn't even use components because we didn't know they existed, but after we figured it out, it saved us so much time. With work being completely erased frequently due to the bug, we had to pay more attention to when things were last synced and not walk over each other's toes.</p>
        <p>To get through our tight deadlines without issues, we increasingly had remote work sessions. We hopped on a call, shared screen when required, and just talked through what we were doing so we didn't step over each other's toes, to maximize efficiency. This was also helpful when ideating.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge 4: Working with the copywriter</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>With the copywriter, I quickly realized that sending over the latest designs with a list of changes was not the easiest to work off of. We had to figure out a streamlined approach to make the job as smooth as possible on both sides. So I came up with a better process - to create a document with the exact component and copy requirements for every component that requires an update. This took me an extra half-hour once a week but saved a lot of meeting time and back and forth emails, and quickened the turnaround time for copy changes from the copywriter. Definitely a win!</p>
    </div>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We delivered six experience design files with over 200 pages and associated states for desktop and mobile for two platforms and users with annotations and diagrams/flows. We also:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li>Presented and delivered designs and determined areas of risk to both the business and developers.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with designers on other pods to align new designs with existing design patterns.</li>
    <li>Improved the process for working with the copywriter, making updates more efficient.</li>
    <li>Identified areas for improvement within the existing design team's resources and design processes, initiating discussions and kick-starting an improvement plan. We also included actionable suggestions that were then carried out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>While designing, we wanted to be future-ready especially considering designs take months to build out and eventually rolled out. To ensure future work did not get lost, we kept them in the working file and annotated the current versus future states, clearly outlining their UI and functionality.</p>
<p>Given the crazy amount of work completed over the seven months, the working file was a living, breathing document. Still, some things definitely needed to be passed down to the future designers, given there will definitely be iterations in the future. Realizing that person-to-person knowledge transfer is not feasible and that separate documentation may be a security issue, we utilized the working document. We were already outlining parked designs for future work in red, but I made sure to create notes on the working file that explain where we left off and why specific design decisions were made. My decision to include this was to help bridge that gap that was always apparent when picking up where past designers left off, often causing duplicate work without knowing it. This paired with our concise annotations, we hoped this would be a good guide for whoever would be taking on the design work in the future.</p>

    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <h3>Improved Adobe XD skills: component everything</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>This project really taught me how to use XD at a high and efficient level. I learned to utilize components extensively, ensure components are well structured, and now understand the collaboration limitations of XD. Also, remembering to close  XD at least twice a day prevented my laptop from exploding. </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Bring in visual design earlier</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>Bringing in visual design late in the process made things difficult. Given the incomplete design system, sometimes there would be existing components that I would not be aware of that would be better suited to the page being designed. Having visual design onboard earlier or even coming up with a smoother workflow that translated wires and high-level designs into actual visual design components would have been helpful. That way, stakeholders could see the ideas come to life sooner, repetitive work could be reduced, and knowledge from the visual designer could be brought to the table sooner.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Be strategic when to bring in a copywriter</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>Every project is different, and bringing in a copywriter early on can save a project money and headache later. But, for this particular project, with things rapidly changing, having the copywriter step in too early brought a lot of rework for the copywriter. These pages weren't heavy on content as they were on the processes and updating the experience on the pages, so the content generated early on was often removed or changed. There was also a lot of work on myself to highlight every little copy change that needed to be addressed, not just for one version of the design but several. Having over 14 revisions of the copy deck at the end of the process was a lot. Bringing in the copywriting a little later in this particular project would have made the process less confusing.</p>
