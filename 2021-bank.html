    <p class="description">Rebuilding two platforms from this Canadian big five bank, from the ground up with new microservices and a completely new front end. Undertaking the designs of six different features (mini-projects) among the two business banking platforms, was a challenge my pod was up for.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Most people are familiar with personal banking but there is another side of retail banking that belongs to businesses: from those with single stores handling transactions for everyday business purchases, to those with multiple locations or personnel who are sending and receiving hundreds of transactions a day. The later is the type of platform I designed for throughout this case study with my UX design teammate.</p>
    <p>Our pod was in charge of six features between two business banking platforms. These features would allow business customers to send and receive payments, authorize payments, manage business account transaction limitations, deal with remittance information, and track wire payments. Many of these processes were done manually with people and paper, so our pod had to design the manual processes for the digital space, as well as add in new functionality.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>We worked on the six different features/sections simultaneously, with more focus on one or two at a time, if they relied on each other and to ensure we got feedback from technology and stakeholders earlier in the process.<p>
    <p>We worked in three main phases within the approved design tool, Adobe XD:</p>
    <p>The process we took was divided into three main phases, all in Adobe XD which was our approved design tool:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>High-Level Design </b>(creating high-level flows and wireframes)</li>
        <li><b>Detailed Design </b>(creating detailed annotated wireframes including all states and edge cases)</li>
        <li><b>Visual Design </b>(creating design specifications accurate to the expected look and feel)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We worked closely with the business to keep this fast-paced project on track and up to/above expectations throughout.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>1: High-level design phase</h2>
    <p>We needed to first understand the user goals and motivations. My first two weeks on the project were spent going through existing files (style guides and interaction designs), participating in meetings, asking a ton of questions, and touching base with other pods working on other functions on the platform.</p>
    <p>My pod had the opportunity to have multiple meetings with SMEs and the employee business banking platform users. These meetings helped us better understand the processes and the pain points in the experience. Some of these processes were completely manual so digitizing them required an in-depth understanding of the existing manual processes.</p>
    <img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-bank/meeting-questions.jpg" alt="questions and notes taken during a meeting">
        <small>Many questions were prepared before the SME meetings and loads of information were captured during. All this data was synthesized afterwards to help guide the designs.</small>
    <h3>Requirements + takeaways from stakeholder meetings</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Send and Recieve Payments</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Ability to create/delete a payment, multi-beneficiary payments etc.</li>
            <li>Business accounts deal with tens to hundreds or more transactions within any given business day.</li>
            <li>All transactions have limits (Interac only up to 25k, company limits are set for the entire company) and must be authorized by an entitled user (payments cannot be approved by a creator).</li>
            <li>Ability to print/export everything seen.</li>
            <li>Search functionality - need to determine what is is most important variables to search by.</li>
            <li>Pagination or lazy loading needs to be defined.</li>
            <li>There is a concept of drafting a payment which should be available to creators and approvers (all other users are view only users)</li>
            <li>Payments will be in different states depending on the approval process. This needs to be thoroughly mapped out in detailed design.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Authorization & Entitlement</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Authorization: Give System Administrators (SAs) (business customers) in an organization the ability to approve payments. Currently SAs can only view/manage individual users, but business customers would like to be able to give authorization to a group of users at a time.</li>
            <li>Entitlement: DBank employees can set entitlements to Business customers, creating SAs that can create payments (access management to set, create, or approve access). This feature would enable the management of a user account's real time payment services.</li>
            <li>Account removal and deletion should be available for both.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Billing</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Goals are to optimize revenue, reduce operational risks, set consumer centric pricing and billing. DBank employee.</li>
            <li>Business customers would need a way to view bills.</li>
            <li>There are front office and back office DBank employees - some features only available to some so just design for both until a business decision can be made. Terminology is different (just need to note for business logic).</li>
            <li>Need to show all accounts attached to the service for billing services.</li>
            <li>There are product specific billing preferences which affect the information that is shown on screen.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Recipients (Beneficiary)</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Accessible from the Payments landing page.</li>
            <li>Ability to search recipients (only first 1000 results available).</li>
            <li>Ability to see all at once.</li>
            <li>Ability to export a list of recipients - Business is not sure why yet.</li>
            <li>Ability to save recipients.</li>
            <li>Ability to delete a saved recipient by entering recipient id.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Remittance Information</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Ability to add additional notes or attachments when sending a payment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Wire Payments</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Very limited information here, but we can plan this to be scalable for the future.</li>
            <li>There was some archived exploration done but this needs to be revisited.</li>
            <li>There is some logic to this that needs to be mapped out for detailed design.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Creating the high-level designs</h3>
    <p>In this phase, we created high-level user task flows for the happy paths, and the unhappy paths. These were designed given the points above (plus other detailed notes we gathered from interviews). The designs were iterated upon until we gained stakeholder approval. We decided to hold stakeholder meetings three times a week to iterate quickly.</p>
    <img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-bank/highlevelflow.jpg" alt="high-level flow from Adobe XD">
        <small>Our high-level flows captured the most common screens related to a user's task. This is an example of a high level flow for creating a payment as a business customer.</small>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>2: Detailed design phase</h2>
    <p>Our general process ended up going like this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Creating high-level designs and any supplementary documentation that would help development and business understand, including flow charts and state diagrams.</li>
        <li>Including edge cases, error states, and anything short of visual designs.</li>
        <li>Highlighting features for future state development vs short-term development.</li>
        <li>Adding to the changelog at the top of the design file.</li>
        <li>Exporting a PDF of the newest version of designs for developers.</li>
        <li>Creating a meeting agenda and questions to ask business and technology.</li>
        <li>Presenting designs at the stakeholder meeting, getting approvals and answers, and finding out any new changes, requirements, and constraints.</li>
        <li>Updating designs.</li>
        <li>Reiterate and repeat all steps until stakeholders approve.</li>
    </ol>

    

    
        <h3>Supporting Documentation</h3>
        <p>In the client contract, our deliverables were a high-level design with annotations for development. Pretty straightforward, <em>right?</em></p>
        <div>
            <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge: Showcasing all designs and intentions in a PDF document</h3>
            <div class="bordercomponent">
                <p>Once we dived into the finer details, having only wireframes with annotations wasn't enough. More documentation would be necessary to ensure the developers had what they needed to implement accurate designs.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The work extended to include flow charts, state diagrams, word documents and anything that would help the ideas our pod designed to come into existence. State Diagrams were very useful for developers to quickly understand the logic behind the designs.</p>
        <img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-bank/Payment-Transfers-State-Diagram.jpg" alt="State Diagram example">
            <small>An example of one of the state diagrams delivered with detailed annotations. This state diagram helped make the logic of Interac e-transfer and wire payment statuses clear. Clearly defining these statuses made creating designs easier and ensured that all stakeholders taking part of development were on the same page.</small>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
        <p>Going through the different flows we got to a point where interaction patterns had to be considered and clearly documented. I conducted research on best practices, then outlined how navigation should be handed throughout both platforms we were designing for. This was later included in our design system to be applied to both Business Banking platforms being designed.</p>
        <p>Animations of how the transitions behaved (fade, slide, etc.) were not considered at the time since it was not in scope and was not a roadblocker for my pod's designs to be completed.</p>
        <img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-bank/InteractionDocumentation-Overlays.png" alt="State Diagram example">
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Annotated Wireframes</h3>
        <p>The annotations described elements on the page and changes in state. I've received a lot of feedback from my work on this project and one thing was consistent - I'm pretty meticulous with my annotations. For all 200+ boards we created (pages and states), I'm pretty happy with this!</p>

            <small>An example of annotated wireframes delivered.</small>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>3: Visual design phase</h2>
    <p>The visual designer we worked with was the same visual designer for multiple pods. Her capacity made it also the job of myself and my UX design team member to complete some of the visual designs, and ensure we got them approved by the visual designer.</p>
    <p>At the time of the project, Adobe XD did not provide a way to show design specifications to document viewers, and the developers and stakeholders consuming the design documentation preferred PDF. Due to this, all visual design specifications had to be explicitly specified. Sizing for character, icon, and font sizing were supported by the style guide.</p>
    <img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-bank/Visual-Design-Example.jpg" alt="Visual Design example">
    <small>An example of visual designs delivered.</small>
    <p>Inspecting designs wasn't available on this project as the developers and all business personnel requested PDF documentation for hand off rather than jumping into the XD cloud files. Due to this inefficiency and many other reasons, Figma is being transitioned to in the organization as off 2022.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Given the user tasks to solve and many new asks throughout the project, the number of potential pages <em>grew quickly</em>. Not to mention, we were facing a few other challenges: an inconsistent design system, and my UX designer teammate and I have both never worked with Adobe XD before. Hiccups we encountered included <b>lost work, sync issues, and time lost by not fully utilizing Adobe XD's features</b>.</p>
        
        <div>
            <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge: Technical constraints and scope changes</h3>
            <div class="bordercomponent">
                <p>We ran into multiple blockers that stemmed from technical constraints during the process. We had a large scope and little time, but we were able to surpass these blockers and bring efficiency by ensuring communication among our team and stakeholders was clear. Design ideas were brought up as early as possible to development and business to determine any technical limitations (especially evident in companies with legacy software). We streamlined meetings with stakeholders by sending out an agenda prior to and emailing any questions that didn't require a meeting. Changes were logged in all working files and included with every deliverable, to help everyone keep track.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge: Inconsistent design system</h3>
            <div class="bordercomponent">
                <p>The platforms we were designing for had strict accessibility constraints, so we relied on pre-existing components that had approval from legal, accessibility, etc. Any new components required a strong case and to be fully reviewed by accessibility.</p>
                <p>As soon as I started the project, I realized that the design system we had been using was missing details required for development. Upon further search, older components included those missing specifications but were inconsistent with the newer design system. I brought this up to the bank's experience design lead early in the project.</p>
                <p>From that discussion, our pod started our own fleshed-out visual design component library and design system we used for all our six mini-projects. We held weekly sessions to discuss progress, components, and make decisions. This design system included things that were not clear in the older design systems and new components and interactions related to our mini-projects. This initiative helped us greatly to get through our delivery dates and ensured that the correct interactions and sizes were available to developers. <small>Note: This was a priority, but as the project unravelled, we discovered a team undertook the task of creating a design system for <em>all</em> of the bank's various platforms. This was great news; learning something better would be coming in the future. If the initiative didn't exist, it would be something I would have pushed the design leads and ultimately the client to undertake.</small></p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge: Improving our workflow as a team while using the ever so buggy Adobe XD</h3>
            <div class="bordercomponent">
                <p>As the number of pages we created increased, Adobe XD didn't want to cooperate. Errors regularly came up: component elements were out of place, XD was processing slowly, and work was sometimes completely erased. The 'reset component' feature helped with the misplaced elements on an artboard. Closing XD frequently helped clear our RAM, and better structure in our components and layers helped keep XD working smoothly. In the beginning, we didn't even use components because we didn't know they existed, but after we figured it out, it saved so much time. With work being completely erased frequently due to the bug, we had to pay more attention to when things were last synced and not walk over each other's toes.</p>
                <p>To get through our tight deadlines without issues, we increasingly had remote work sessions. We hopped on a call, shared screen when required, and just talked through what we were doing to maximize efficiency. This was also helpful when ideating.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="challenge-title">Challenge: Working with the copywriter</h3>
            <div class="bordercomponent">
                <p>I quickly learned that sending over the latest designs with a list of changes was not the easiest for the copywriter to work off of. We had to figure out a streamlined approach to make the job as smooth as possible on both sides. So, I came up with a better process - to create a document with the exact component and copy requirements for every component requiring updates. This took me an extra half-hour once a week but saved a lot of meeting time and back-and-forth emails, and quickened the turnaround time for copy changes from the copywriter. Definitely a win!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 id="results">Final handoff</h2>
    <p>We delivered six experience design files with over 200 pages and associated states for desktop and mobile for two platforms and users with annotations, diagrams, and flows. We also:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Presented and delivered designs, highlighting areas of risk to both the business and developers.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with designers on other pods to align new designs with existing design patterns.</li>
        <li>Improved the process for working with the copywriter, making updates more efficient.</li>
        <li>Identified areas for improvement within the existing design team's resources and design processes, initiating discussions and kick-starting an improvement plan. We also included actionable suggestions that were then carried out.</li>
    </ul>

        <small>A white-listed version of what one of the designs looked like with visual design applied.</small>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>While designing, we wanted to be future-ready especially considering designs take months to build out and eventually rolled out. To ensure future work did not get lost, we kept them in the working file and annotated the current versus future states, clearly outlining their UI and functionality.</p>
    <p>Given the crazy amount of work completed over the seven months, the working file was a living, breathing document. Still, some things definitely needed to be passed to future designers for reference and future iterations. Person-to-person knowledge transfer is not feasible and separate documentation may be a security issue, so we decided to utilize the working file. We were already outlining parked designs for future work in red, but I made sure to create notes on the working file explaining where our pod left off and why specific design decisions were made. This was to help bridge that gap that was always apparent when picking up where past designers left off; often causing duplicate work without knowing it. Paired with concise annotations, we felt confident in the work we completed.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Mastering Adobe XD + component everything</h3>
        <div class="bordercomponent">
            <p>This project really taught me how to use XD at a high and efficient level. I learned to utilize components extensively, ensure components are well structured, and now understand the collaboration limitations of XD. Also, closing XD at least twice a day prevented my laptop from exploding. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>Bring in visual design earlier</h3>
        <div class="bordercomponent">
            <p>Visual design coming in late in the process made things difficult. Given the incomplete design system, sometimes existing components I was not aware of would be better suited to the page being designed. Having visual design onboard earlier and there for each design, or even coming up with a smoother workflow to translate wireframes into actual visual design components would have been helpful. That way, stakeholders could see the ideas come to life sooner, repetitive work could be minimized, and knowledge from the visual designer could be brought to the table sooner.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Be strategic when bringing in a copywriter</h3>
        <div class="bordercomponent">
            <p>Every project is different, and bringing in a copywriter early on can save project money and headache later. For this particular project, with things rapidly changing, having the copywriter step in too early brought a lot of rework for the copywriter. These pages weren't heavy on content as they were on the processes and updating the experience on the pages, so the content generated early on was often removed or changed. There was a lot of work on myself to highlight every little copy change that needed to be addressed, not just for one version of the design but several. Having over 14 revisions of the copy deck at the end of the process was a lot. Bringing in the copywriting a little later for each mini project in this particular project would have made the process less confusing.</p>
