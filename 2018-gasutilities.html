<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Envisioning and designing what the current customer-facing website experience and appearance can be transformed into - given the current technological implementation and feasible possibilities.</p>
<p>My focus on this project was on the redesign of the customer-facing Sitecore website (2.0), while at the time, the initial website I previously worked on was on the verge of being launched (1.0).</p>
<p>The project was very vague at first - the work order was ambiguous on what was to be delivered, artifacts were outdated, and every aspect of the customer experience was being transformed.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Analysis, interviews, and design workshops would all help inform the improvements we needed to design for. Prioritizing experiences to discover which were key to the client would then lead the path of what should be designed first. From those top prioties, we were to design the happy and unahppy paths and showcase them through flows, documents, wireframes, and prototypes, and deliver technically feasible designs.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>Research & Analysis</h3>
<p>I started by getting familiarized with the project through reports, personas, and user journeys. These artifacts gave me insight into who the target users were, their needs, and how they performed tasks. With this, there were still holes as to what the requirements were and the priority for upcoming sprints. To solve this, client meetings, deep dives, and team inquiries were used to gather more information.</p>
<p>My process always began with finding out what the feature was, if it was already existing or if enhancements needed to be made, gathering information and creating idea boards.</p>

</div>

<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>Requirements were gathered, user stories made, and prioritization was finalized after a series of workshops.</p>

<h3>Defining use cases and creating </h3>
<p>From there, our team designed an optimized user experience delivered through information architecture, use cases and scenarios, flow/logic diagrams to describe design based on user interaction, and wireframes made on Sketch.</p>

<h3>Urgent! UX analysis of the site under content migration</h3>
<p>So there were two things happening: 1. bringing the client site into Sitecore, with nothing changed except the UI (so no feature updates). 2. A newer version of the site with new flows, processes, and basically a whole new experience (what I've been working on in this project up to this point).</p>
<p>As we were desigining the newer experiences, help was urgently needed for (1), the site being migrated into a Sitecore Content Management System (CMS) website with UI changes. At this point, the migration was has been underway for about 9 months, and it was now ready to go through with the client to input any missing content and validate the entire website has been implemented as expected.</p>
<p>The basis of this project was to move all the content from the existing site, update it, and add in new content. This process was not by any means automated, but manually entered into the Sitecore editor. This ended up being more work than expected as the UI was not implemented according to specifications. My expertise was required to manage user interface and user experience (UI/UX) issues and to offer guidance to offshore teams of what to do to make fixes, log tickets to fix UI issues, create new design assets for offshore to implement, and spend extra time with the client to identify issues and strategize how they would be fixed. The content migration took <em>weeks</em> of daily client meetings and working on weekends in order to plan and then delegate tasks to the offshore development team.</p>

<h3>Solutioning: Design system</h3>
<p>After my work on the 1.0 site under migration, I was welcomed back to designing the 2.0 site. Visual design work was completed as I was gone, and I came in at a time where I could help with the design system. Using sketch I worked off of what the visual designer had started, and added more components that haven't been included.</p>

<h3>Solutioning: Annotating designs</h3>
<p>I worked closely with developers to ensure the experiences and visual designs we created were technically feasible. This involved plenty of annotations with comment feedback directly on the designs on Invision, and meetings with developers.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>1.0 Site: UX analysis and content migration</h3>
<p>I proactively monitored, managed, and reported on execution of the following:<p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li>Evaluate content quality and manage the content migration between the client and offshore teams.
    <li>Conduct client meetings to identify and resolve content gaps.</li>
    <li>Conduct meetings with the offshore team to get progress feedback and clarify content gap information from the client for offshore to resolve gap issues.</li>
    <li>Track and manage issues on an issue tracker and identify when a web page is ready for client approval for deployment.</li>
    <li>Enter content changes onto Sitecore through the Rich Text editor.</li>
    <li>Provide offshore with pixel perfect designs for components that required rework for the current design implementation.</li>
    <li>This website is now up and running, check it out here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0 Site: New and updated features</h3>
<p>It was an intense four months. Over the beginning four months of the two-year project, our design team was able to address 11 of 14 epics, and for 22 of the 43 features, our team created wireframes and prototypes.</p>
<p>All in all, here is a summarized list of all the things I've worked on for the customer-facing web 2.0 redesign:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li>Scheduled and conducted client meetings and workshops</li>
    <li>Generated user stories</li>
    <li>User flows on Excel and Invision</li>
    <li>Created decks for sprint reveals on Keynote and Powerpoint</li>
    <li>Created and edited wireframes and mockups on Sketch and Balsamiq</li>
    <li>Began the design system on Sketch</li>
    <li>Advised on font usage to colleagues and coworkers</li>
    <li>Added notes to designs to assist the onshore and offshore development teams in implementing designs accurately</li>
    <li>Fostered an excellent relationship with the client and my team (this part was truly awesome, especially since I spent so much time at the client site and working on this project)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>I left when the development work was already underway. The next phase of work for the other epics and features was to be continued by the next design team.</p>

<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>This particular project was significant in terms of scope. It was very exciting but very challenging, and it really taught me a lot in such a short amount of time. It was like a kick in the butt mentally and physically but I really felt it touched upon so many parts of the development cycle which was super cool so early in my career.</p>
<h3>Development environments and the testing cycle</h3>
<div class="bordercomponent">
  <p>I never really understood how different environments worked in practice. This proved to be extra important when validating whether designs were correctly implemented, and when release would happen. Just having a a general understanding of a project's pipeline and what each environment was for is something I'll now ask when working in a transformation or general release.</p>
</div>

<h3>Everyone is human, and small things can snowball</h3>
<div class="bordercomponent">
  <p>Sometimes one small thing can make a huge difference. On this project this was because of one question and a loose answer, which resulted in the base template being incorrectly implemented, and essentially all components and being incorrectly sized and spaced throughout. This change resulted in a month of work for over eight people, and delaying a release date by over a month. Catching things early and verifying design decisions as a team is important.</p>
</div>

<h3>It's ok to say "no"</h3>
<div class="bordercomponent">
  <p>This is the one piece of advice I was given by my project manager after finishing the project. This project was very mentally and physically taxing, and since I was so early in my career I didn't want to say no as to not lose on this great opportunity to make an impact. How this would make me feel by the end of the project was not something I anticipated - I was burnt out. I guess my project manager could tell with all the over time, how much I was able to output, and who knows what other tells, of how much it really affected me. It was a good lesson to learn that making time for yourself not just after a project but within a project is so important. If you're not 100%, how can you effiently deliver something that is 100% without it adding tax to your mental or physical state? I'm a huge advocate for work-life balance; Work will still be there in the morning.</p>

<h3>There are always a lot of moving pieces</h3>
<div class="bordercomponent">
  <p>Not one person can know everything. Especially in tech, things can become outdate quickly, and in consulting and isolated pieces of work, it xan be hard to track down the right information. Being proactive and utilizing tools like confluence, wiki, or sometype of knowledge base kept up to up to date can help prevent lost information. Being organized to help access this information is also a key. FOr this project and many after, documentation, even though agile may be the development metholodgy followed, is important for future work.</p>
</div>

<h3>I am a professional</h3>
<div class="bordercomponent">
  <p>This project really boosted my confidence as a designer. I realized the value I have in having a development background, which gave me the opportunity to work with the client directly and delegate to offshore teams. I also realized my capabilities in so many different parts of the design process - from assisting in workshops, interviews, synthesizing information, and envisioning new experiences. Being able to work with so many different people across various teams, and having them give me positive fedback all throughout really did make me feel that only months after graduation - I am a professional who does belong in the wide world of tech.</p>
