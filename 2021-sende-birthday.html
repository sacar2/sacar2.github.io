    <p class="role">Founder @ Sende Self-Care Essentials</p>
    <p class="description">Since launching our self-care brand, Sende, we received a ton of love and feedback. To celebrate our first year and all our accomplishments, we decided to make some changes based on what our community had to say and reflect our vision for the future.</p>

    <h2>Our vision</h2>
    <p>We want Sende to be a platform to encourage <b><em>balance in every day and provide high-quality self-care essentials</b></em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Our high-level goals are:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Share products we love: effectively showcase the value in the products we believe in.</li>
        <li>Create a community that brings overall wellness to the forefront (mind and body).</li>
        <li>Align platform experiences with those our customers are expecting: not overwhelming, easy to navigate, informative, and be where our customers expect us to be.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>What we've heard, found, gathered</h2>
    <p>From quick user testing with our friends and family, product reviews (on the site and in person), Amazon sales, interacting with customers at our first pop-up, and reviewing our current Shopify site, we've gathered a lot of things to consider within our first year.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Things that stuck with me</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>People are loving our products and branding but aren't leaving reviews on our platforms</li>
            <li>People need more hand-holding to choose products and understand what we're selling</li>
            <li>Images need to be more functional (lifestyle photos!) and feel more luxury (to align with price and quality)</li>
            <li>Peshtemal sets are easy to do and we should do it</li>
            <li>Customers are interested in sustainability and animal testing of our products (must be sustainable and not tested on animals)</li>
            <li>Face keses should be looked into</li>
            <li>We shouldn't rule out our rough kese with the band - it might get more initial sales</li>
            <li>Showcasing our back kese and our sand and black sand peshtemals as top sellers  might be helpful to customers</li>
            <li>Consider adding charity when purchasing</li>
            <li>Our overall business and marketing strategy needs to be catered to for all platforms (concerning, but we're learning!)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>Based on everything we've collected from the past year and imagining where we want to be, I ideated actions we could take. I clustered them and then identified top priorities for launch.</p>
    
    <img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-sende/todos-ideateactions.jpg" alt="Stickes on a figjam board ideating actions that can be taken based on past years feedback.">
        <small>Ideas of possible actions that can be taken based on past year's feedback.</small>
        
    <img class="project-image" src="assets/2021-sende/todos-clusterandprioritize.jpg" alt="Stickes on a figjam board of prioritized actions that can be taken based on past years feedback">
        <small>Actionable items were clustered and then prioritized.</small>
</div>
    <div>
        <h2>Taking action</h2>
        <p>With so much uncovered and only one person managing the Shopify store, prioritization was key. Realizing only working on the www.sende.ca Shopify site was achievable before launch and the most impactful, I focused on  creating requirements for a first birthday Shopify site revamp:</p>
        <h3>Homepage</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Include customer reviews as social proof without being obstructive</li>
            <li>The homepage should showcase brand id and values, and ensure customers understand our products</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Update Copy</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Bring kese and peshtemal benefits to the forefront on collection and detail pages</li>
            <li>Guide customers to make decisions and choose products (keses and headbands)</li>
            <li>Implement consistent copy: lower case everything except nouns and paragraphs with more than one sentence</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Update images to be more contextual</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Update peshtemal and headband images to lifestyle images related to travel, beauty, children, and body-care</li>
                <li>Kese default images should show them being worn/held</li>
                <li>Provide videos on the kese detail pages and the collection page to give more context and understanding</li>
                <li>Update collection images to give more of a clean luxury feel</li>
                <li>Show kese images of the dead skin exfoliation last (to maintain a clean initial appearance)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Increase usability</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Increase the legibility of product detail pages (too blocky currently)</li>
            <li>Make the mobile app less overwhelming due to unnecessary features:
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Remove the chat feature, no one has been using it anyways</li>
                    <li>Remove the Loox Popup from the homepage and product pages to reduce how overwhelming it is, and adjust the timing where it does appear</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The how-to page should be easy to read</li>
            <li>Product pages hide the name of the product due to improper sizing of images - resize to be all the same height (square or landscape)</li>
            <li>Related products at bottom of pages are not all the same height (change from aspect fit to portrait)</li>
            <li>Highlight back kese, black sand and sand peshtemals as top sellers to help users make decisions quicker!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Add peshtemal set (2 or 4)</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>Non-birthday priorities - other takeaways</h3>
        <p>None of the key takeaways from the year and the derived todos will be lost!</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li><b>Amazon</b>: We are actively trying to ramp this up. Ads aren't working out so well but we're going to try to improve this by doing some adjustments to our ad campaigns. We also recently filed for trademarking Sende, giving us access to Amazon's Brand Registry. Our <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/stores/page/563FAAA1-0BB4-4C05-B53E-7928A096C811">Amazon store</a> is set up and in the process of being linked to from our listings!</li>
            <li><b>Gathering reviews to increase trust</b>: We've made a huge effort to gain reviews, offering discounts to customers on their next purchase, sending reminders to Amazon customers, and asking family and friends. More research on strategies that work needs to be done. Also, we are considering Amazon Vine.</li>
            <li><b>Business and Marketing Strategy</b>: This is a big one. Marketing and social media are being taken a look at, and our business strategy is the foundation of everything we're doing, so it's our top priority which we're continuously adjusting.</li>
            <li><b>Product research and development:</b> We have a couple of things being tested and researched, but to not rush into anything as to maintain cash flow and ensure we can handle what we already have going on, we're just going at it at a comfortable pace. Still excited though!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>How to celebrate</h2>
    <p>In addition to the action items to address based on our past feedback and future goals, we did some initial research, individual ideation, and then regrouped to define what we wanted to do for our birthday. Ideas focused on brand awareness, customer appreciation, and collaborations. With just the two of us and time on the line, we decided to:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Have a 20% birthday discount: to show customer appreciation and increase brand awareness</li>
        <li>Revamp the Shopify website: to improve the user experience for our existing and new customers (covered by the previous activity)</li>
        <li>Launch a peshtemal duo set: because customers have been asking for peshtemal sets and we love launching new things</li>
        <li>Instagram giveaway: A kese trio! We believe keses are our star products so we want to raise awareness of this</li>
        <li>Social media, blog, and email post about our one year and everything we're looking forward to</li>
    </ul>

        <small>Some ideas for how we could celebrate our birthday as a small business. With limited time we ended up just doing a few things!</small>

<div>
    <h2>Revamping sende.ca</h2>
    <p>I picked a new Shopify theme and then started working off of the requirements/todos. Luckily I'm a one-person team and the little structure allowed me to get things done quickly.</p>
    <div>
        <h3>Homepage: before</h3>
        <img src="assets/2021-sende/old homepage.jpg">
            
        <h3>Homepage: after</h3>
        <img src="assets/2021-sende/new homepage.jpg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Collection pages</h3>
        
        <h4>Peshtemal page before and after</h4>
        <p>Using lifestyle images instead of flat lays gives context of how to use the products, and as a bonus reduces scrolling through unnecesary content. Product values were pulled to the top to help customers understand the product and it's benefits.</p>

        <img src="assets/2021-sende/pestemal page.jpg">

        <h4>Kese page before and after</h4>
        <p>The older kese page weighed more in text with little structure. In the new page, product images show how to hold/use the kese to understand the product better. At the bottom of the page, more information is given with a video and clearer care instructions, which is in addition to the product benefits at the top of the page.</p>

    <h2>How do we measure success?</h2>
    <p>Strictly for Instagram and sende.ca, we need to determine if our efforts were worth it. Some things we'll be keeping track of:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Social media outreach and followers</li>
        <li>Instagram profile and www.sende.ca visits and sales</li>
        <li>Community page sign-ups</li>
        <li>New email list sign-ups</li>
        <li>Qualitative feedback and reviews</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We need to monitor these KPIs, and just see how it goes!</p>
    <p>See it live at <a href="https://www.sende.ca">www.sende.ca</a>. See our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_sende/">Instagram account, @_sende</a>.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>Our second year will be more focused on growth. We gathered a lot of learnings from our first year so to improve on that we'll be taking the action items ideated and carrying them out if we can. On top of that, we have a general strategy we've mapped out (which includes the "Non-birthday priorities - other takeaways") and we'll see how it goes!</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <h3>User feedback is crucial</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>The only way we know we're delivering a good customer experience is by hearing feedback from customers. How are we supposed to know about their feelings and behaviour without being told or by observation? We're so lucky that we have a lot of family and friends support to help us improve. Analytics can only help us gauge so much, especially with little volume. Thankfully we've done our best to talk to our customers to gain that insight.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>There's a lot more than UX and aesthetic</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>The parts we're struggling with are the parts we're unfamiliar with. Mostly marketing/advertising. For this, we must constantly learn and adjust. This is a whole nother feat!</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Time and focus are necessary</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>In a workplace setting, there are always people there to rely on for specialized tasks i.e. copy writers, IT personnel, SMEs, etc. But in the scenario where you're a team of two, additional skills are required and acquiring them takes time and effort. With life happening, we need to stick by our values and balance them the best we can. Keeping our goals in mind, tracking progress and making sure to push through on priorities, and pivoting when needed is the only way we'll make it. Also, we're so happy Asana and similar tools exist!</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Keep it light and purposeful</h3>
    <div class="bordercomponent">
        <p>This is a passion project and a business. If it's not fun and doesn't make money it's not worth doing. Anything can be stressful, but as a human, I've got to manage it by understanding why I feel that way. Giving myself too little time to complete tasks and not taking enough small breaks can affect my stress levels. We only have so much time, so things like music, where I'm working, and having tea and a few snacks affect my mood and productivity. Goal-oriented time blocks and setting up the right environment get me in the zone to do work efficiently and joyfully.</p>
