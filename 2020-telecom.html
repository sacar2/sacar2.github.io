    <h1 class="mark mark-purple inline">How might we design an experience where users can set up their own home internet and cable?</h1>
    <p class="role">Service Designer</p>
    <p>Worked as a service designer in the design of a DIY Wi-Fi and Cable installation customer experience with the goals of reducing technician costs and improving installation times. Deliverables planned at the beginning shifted and what I ended up owning and delivering was a framework to guide the instruction experience and paper-instruction templates to help improve installation success rates.</p>

<h2>Opportunity/Challenge</h2>
<p>Typically cable and home internet installations are carried out 100% by trained technicians who can assess the home, install hardware, and setup software to get a customer all set up. The cost involved per technician on any installation day costs hundreds of dollars; a cost that has been hard to charge or pass onto customers, ultimately becoming a huge cost-item to the client. With the introduction of COVID, the need for a social distanced approach to installation, as well as a faster way for customers to get set up was needed.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The work sold was to design a tiered experience where costs can be off-set, installations can be quickly scaled, and customers would feel empowered to complete the installations themselves. This experience would revolve around a DIY experience, a do it with me experience (DIY with assistance), and a do it for me experience (future). This would entail a home-delivered kit (for home internet and/or cable), instructions, and possibly an application.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>b.r.b.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>b.r.b.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>My deliverables revolved around paper instructions since in-app instruction design was de-scoped. Although my part in the project was completed, I had many thoughts I really wanted the right people to consider. Because of this, I decided to create a document to send off to the client, “Takeaways and Considerations for Designing In-App Instructions”. This document outlined items to help guide the content for in-app instructions, and discussed items I strongly believed needed to be changed or added throughout the customer journey for a smoother and more consistent user experience. Changes to the props such as the website, app, paper-instructions, terminology, and the processes involved.</p>
<p>This 3.5 page document included an annotated example of possible changes to the current work-in-progress installation app, as well as suggested instructions of how to translate the paper-instructions into the work-in-progress installation app for consistency and better user-understanding.</p>

<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>I learned so much by being on this project with such an experienced team. Although it was 1.5 months, the over time worked and the amount of experience gained is really something I feel that I learned from as much as I provided.</p>
